Type: Package
Title: WID-CIN index computation
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Chiara Herzog
Maintainer: Chiara Herzog <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: This package computes the WID-CIN on preprocessed Illumina Methylation Array Data.
    Please ensure best practices with DNA methylation preprocessing before applying this code.
    The index was trained on EPIC array data, thus application to 450K or EPIC version 2 data may cause issues.
    For EPIC version 2 data, ensure that probe names are consistent with EPIC array naming.
    Future versions of the package may include EPIC version 2 compatible code.
