The WID.CIN package computes the WID-CIN index on preprocessed DNA methylation data. The WID-CIN index is described in:

## Installation

You can install the development version of WID.CIN as follows:

``` r
if(!require("devtools")){
  install.packages("devtools")
}

devtools::install_github("chiaraherzog/WID.CIN")
```

## Example usage

The WID_CIN can be easily applied to a beta matrix, where columns represent individuals and rows represent features (CpGs). 

``` r
library(WID.CIN)
index <- WID_CIN(beta)
```

The output is a named vector that can be matched, for instance, to your pheno file.
